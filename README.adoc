= ECMWF Conversational Virtual Assistant

This is the source code belonging to the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence challenge https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/9[#25] of the https://esowc.ecmwf.int/[ECMWF Summer of Weather Code 2020] programme.

The goal of https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/9[our challenge] is to create a chatbot with which external users can have conversions to get their questions answered without the need to make use of other, existing support channels.

To achieve this, we will build up a modern processing pipeline which retrieves content from ECMWF's helpdesk and support-related pages, apply natural language understanding algorithms to build up a semantic knowledge graph and use this knowledge graph to train the Dialogflow-based chatbot.

Users who will make use of our chatbot will hopefully find answers faster than before, and ECMWF's support team gets more time to focus on critical support cases.

NOTE: Currently, all components of the source code are experimental and will be frequently changed. The final version will be available end of August 2020.
