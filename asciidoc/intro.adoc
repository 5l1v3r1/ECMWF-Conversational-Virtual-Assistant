This is the source code belonging to the Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence challenge https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/9[#25] of the https://esowc.ecmwf.int/[ECMWF Summer of Weather Code 2020] programme.

The goal of https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/9[our challenge] is to create a Conversational Virtual Assistant (CVA).


This Conversational Virtual Assistant will provide users of the {ECMWF} (ECMWF), Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) an intuitive and easy to use self-service chat-like interface to get their questions answered without the need to contact the dedicated support services.

To achieve this, we are using natural language processing and machine learning technologies and have implemented a basic knowledge graph connecting to the various relevant content sources. Content sources are for instance the dataset and applications of the Copernicus Climate Datastore, published news articles and press releases, help pages of the support wiki, support forums and so on.

Users who will make use of our chatbot will hopefully find answers faster than before, and ECMWF and C3S's support teams gets more time to focus on critical support cases.
