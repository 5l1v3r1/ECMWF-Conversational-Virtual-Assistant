  "abstract": "<p> <span>In this report we present the first steps towards testing the use of SMOS neural network soil moisture in the </span><span>European Flood Awareness System (EFAS) for the SMOS-Operational Emergency Management (SMOS-E)</span><span>ESA contract (tasks TH1-005, TH1-010 and TH1-015). Currently, EFAS flood forecasts are made from an </span><span>initial soil moisture produced by the LISFLOOD hydrological model, which is driven by 24-hour precipi-</span><span>tation and near-surface temperature and wind observations. In the first part of this report, we compare the </span><span>EFAS initial soil moisture product with the ECMWF SMOS neural network soil moisture, in order to under-</span><span>stand the similarities and differences and the potential of SMOS for improving the initialisation in EFAS.</span><span>Both soil moisture products are also compared to the ERA5 reanalysis soil moisture. Secondly, we present </span><span>results of bias correcting SMOS to EFAS through CDF-matching, a necessary step for SMOS soil moisture</span><span> to be used directly in EFAS. </span><span>Results show that SMOS soil moisture has high correlations to ERA5 in most of Europe (</span><span>&gt;</span><span>0.6), with values </span><span>that are similar to North America and Australia where SMOS is thought to have its best performance. This </span><span>justifies testing the use of SMOS soil moisture for flood forecasting in Europe. SMOS has low correlations to</span><span> both ERA5 and EFAS in parts of Northern Europe (Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland), however, indicating </span><span>that there may be less benefits to using SMOS data for flood forecasting in these regions. Results also</span><span>indicate lower anomaly correlations for SMOS compared to the other datasets, as well as probable biases </span><span>in both EFAS and ERA5. The lower anomaly correlations for SMOS are likely at least partially due to a</span><span>higher noise compared to EFAS and ERA5, as well as to sudden drops in soil moisture that were observed </span><span>in the time series of different gridpoints. These latter drops in soil moisture would need to be filtered before</span><span> SMOS could be used directly in EFAS, e.g. using a first guess check.</span><span>Results of the CDF-matching show that this bias correction method works well for most gridpoints, with the</span><span>exception of some areas where there are strong interannual variations in the seasonal soil moisture cycle.</span><span>This occurs particularly in Iceland, and for some gridpoints in North Africa, and in these areas the data </span><span>would need to be filtered before SMOS soil moisture could be used directly in EFAS. This could also be</span><span> done using a first guess check.</span><span>Finally, in this report we discuss options for the next steps of the project, and make recommendations for </span><span>different experiments that could be performed to test the use of SMOS soil moisture in EFAS.</span></p>",
